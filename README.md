Components

* `Footer.js`: The footer component with copyright information
* `Note.js`: A single note component
* `AddNote.jsx`: A form component to add new notes
* `CreateNotes.jsx`: A component to display all notes
* `GlobalState.jsx`: A context API provider for global state management

Context API
------------

The notememo App uses React's Context API to manage global state. The `GlobalState` component provides a context with the following values:

* `notesList`: An array of all notes
* `addNote`: A function to add a new note to the list

Styles
------

The app uses CSS styles from the `public/styles.css` file. The styles are applied globally to all components.

Notes
-----

* The `notes.js` file contains an empty array of notes. This array is used as the initial state for the `GlobalState` context.
* The `createNote` function in `CreateNotes.jsx` is used to create a new `Note` component for each note in the `notesList` array.
